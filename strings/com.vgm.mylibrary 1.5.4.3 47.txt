    <string name="help_delete_question">How can I delete a book?</string>
    <string name="help_download_directory_answer">"Once you've done an export, the exported files are in the 'Download' directory. The 'Download' directory is at the root of your phone's files. If it does not exist anymore then it is re-created when you do an export, so don't worry about that. On some devices, xls or text files seem to be invisible within default Android file browser. To see them, you can either download another file browser (like ES Explorer for example) or download the official Excel / Word apps for Android. But please note that if the app indicates that the files have been saved, then there is absolutely no doubt that they are saved in the 'Download' folder. It is pure science: this message can't be displayed unless these files are actually in that folder!"</string>
    <string name="help_download_directory_question">"Where are the exported files and the 'Download' directory? I can't find them!"</string>
    <string name="help_export_import_covers_answer">"Images are big files, therefore it is not possible to store them directly in the database. To transfer them from one device to another, you now have two options:&lt;br />&lt;br />1- Directly use the export function to create MyLibraryImages.txt, which is a single file representing all your images. Please, be aware that this file can be very big (usually about 1.5MB for every 10 elements but it can be more), therefore be sure that you have enough space on your phone or the export will probably fail. To recover your images, put the MyLibraryImages.txt file in the \"Download\" folder of your new device then use the import function (do not forget to check the dedicated checkbox).&lt;br />&lt;br />2- Just copy the \"MyLibrary\" folder (that is next to the \"Download\" folder) from your original device to your second device. Once this is done, the app will be able to show your covers on your new device if you made an \"mylibrary.db\" import with override. This won't work if you imported your data from an XLS file because XLS files cannot persist database ids and database ids are linked to covers."</string>
    <string name="help_export_import_covers_question">How can I export / import my covers from one device to another?</string>
    <string name="help_from_wishlist_to_library_answer">Just long press the item in the wishlist, and you will be able to move it to your library.</string>
    <string name="help_from_wishlist_to_library_question">How can I move an item from my wishlist to my library?</string>
    <string name="help_help_app_answer">Yes! First, you can make a donation with PayPal by &lt;a href=\"mylibrary://donate\">clicking here&lt;/a>. Then, if you buy books directly with the Amazon links that are in your wishlist, I will receive a very small percentage of the transaction (usually less than 0.5$). You will pay the same price so it will make no difference to you, but it could make a difference to me. Therefore if you usually buy books on Amazon, do not hesitate to do it within My Library. Thank you!</string>
    <string name="help_help_app_question">Is there any other way to help the application?</string>
    <string name="help_import_xls_blank_line_answer">This error probably means that you modified your XLS file with OpenOffice or Google Sheets. These applications have different ways to encode their Excel files and that makes them incompatible with Excel import, sorry about that. To fix this problem, just copy and paste your data in a brand new Excel Sheet (into Excel this time), save it and voila! You can now import it.</string>
    <string name="help_import_xls_blank_line_question">"When I try to import my XLS file, the app indicates that line number X has a blank field for title or author and that this is not allowed. But the last line of my file is the line before line X, so that's perfectly normal!"</string>
    <string name="help_import_xls_required_format_answer">The Excel file to import must have a particular format to be successfully imported. The best way to check this format is to add at least one book to your library, then make an Excel export and look at the format of the exported Excel file. The exported file format is the same as the required import format.</string>
    <string name="help_import_xls_required_format_question">What is the required format (sheet names, column names, etc.) to make a successful Excel import?</string>
    <string name="help_improve_database_answer">Yes you can! Just create an account at &lt;a href=\"https://openlibrary.org\">Open Library&lt;/a> and start adding books!</string>
    <string name="help_improve_database_question">Can I improve the app database by any mean?</string>
    <string name="help_incomplete_xls_file_answer">The XLS file is fine, the problem comes from your computer : just unplug your phone from it and replug it, that should solve your issue.</string>
    <string name="help_incomplete_xls_file_question">My exported XLS file is not complete!</string>
    <string name="help_isbn_apis_answer">"My Library uses Google, Amazon, Open Library, IsbnPlus, Worldcat, Moly, data.bn and Biblio services in order to match ISBN numbers and the books you are looking for, therefore if an ISBN number is not found, it is because it is not referenced within those services. Unfortunately this is out of my reach, but I'll keep an eye on new available book services, and rest assured, the best ones will be added in future updates."</string>
    <string name="help_isbn_apis_question">How does the app match books and ISBN numbers?</string>
    <string name="help_isbn_format_answer">An example of valid ISBN : 2–07–042277–1&lt;br />The dashes are accepted for readability matters, but they are not mandatory, therefore you will get the same result with 2070422771. Give it a try!</string>

    <string name="help_mylibrary.db_question">"What type of file 'mylibrary.db' is? Can I read it from my computer?"</string>
    <string name="help_mylibrary_db_answer">"'mylibrary.db' is a database file corresponding to your library. You can read it on a computer with SqliteBrowser, then export it as a CSV file, but I recommend to use the in-app XLS export instead."</string>

    <string name="help_rating_answer">By rating the app 5 stars on Google Play, you support the creation of this independent, free and ad-free application.

    <string name="help_rating_question">Why is it important to rate the app 5 stars on Google Play if you like it?</string>
    <string name="help_read_books_answer">No! As stated in the Google Play description, My Library is an app that allows you to list and sort your library. It is not a book reader. There are a lot of book readers on Android but My Library is not one of them.</string>
    <string name="help_read_books_question">Can I read books within My Library?</string>
    <string name="help_save_data_answer">"You have many ways to save your data, which can be divided in two categories: the database and the covers. For details on covers export / import, go to the next question. You can:&lt;br />&lt;br />- Export \"mylibrary.db\" file. This is your database. You cannot read it but you can import your data on any other device with nothing else but with file.&lt;br />&lt;br />- Export \"MyLibrary.xls\" file. This file is an Excel representation of your database. You can do whatever you want with it and use it to recover your data with XLS import if you want. I would not recommend to use XLS import if you can use database import instead but you're a free human being so do as you like!&lt;br />&lt;br />- Export \"MyLibraryByAuthor.xls\" file. This file is similar to \"MyLibrary.xls\" file but is sorted by author. It cannot be imported.&lt;br />&lt;br />When importing, you can choose to \"override current library\". If this is checked, then all your current data will be deleted and replaced by the imported one. If not checked, all the imported data will be merged to your current data. This can be very useful if you want to scan your library with multiple phones and then merge data, but be aware that this can result in doubles."</string>
